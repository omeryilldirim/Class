//! A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

// For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcisstic:
//     1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
// and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

// 1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938
// The Challenge:

// Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10. This may be True and False in your language, e.g. PHP.
// Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be passed into the function.

function narcissistic(value) {
    const power = String(value).length
    const sum = String(value).split('').reduce((sum, num,i,arr)=> sum + num**arr.lenth ,0)
    return sum === value ? true : false
  }
console.log(narcissistic(153));


//! The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.
// To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

// Input
// Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

// Output
// Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

// Example
// input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
// output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

function openOrSenior(data){
    return data.map(
      ([age, handicap])=> (age >= 55 && handicap > 7) ? "Senior" : "Open")
}

//! Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
// For example (Input --> Output):
// 39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
// 999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
// 4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)

function persistence(num) {
    let result = 0
    while (num > 9){
        const output = String(num).split('').reduce((acc, digit)=> acc * digit)
        num = output
        result++
    }
    return result
 }

 console.log(persistence(39));
 console.log(persistence(999));
 console.log(persistence(4));
