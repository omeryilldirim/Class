// Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a code that given numbers convert to Roman Numerals. The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).

// Example:,
// 1000=M 900=CM 90=XC
// 2008 is written as MMVIII:
// 2000=MM 8=VIII
